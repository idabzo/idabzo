# Hi, I'm Ida 🐝 (she, her)
You might have seen me around if you've ever attended a functional programming event, debated Haskell vs. Scala on the internet, or wondered who actually organizes all these conferences. Spoiler: sometimes, it’s me.

For over a decade, I’ve been marketing tech, building communities, and making sure people show up to the right conference at the right time. My work sits at the intersection of developer advocacy, event organizing, and making complicated things sound interesting. If it involves open-source, functional programming, or tech marketing, chances are, I’ve had my hands in it.

### 😻 What I Do
* Marketing & Community Strategy – If your tech needs an audience, I’ll find them and make them care.
* Conference & Event Organization – If you've been to [geecon](https://geecon.org/), [Confitura](https://confitura.pl), [Lambda Days](https://www.lambdadays.org), or [Scalar](https://www.scalar-conf.com), I was probably in the background, ensuring everything ran smoothly (or at least that the chaos was well-managed).
* Open Source & Developer Relations – I help OSS projects get noticed, supported, and celebrated.
* Security Curious – Learning my way into the security space, because breaking things (ethically!) is fun.
### 💜 Notable Achievements (or "Things That Took a Lot of Coffee")
* Scala Community – Co-organized Scalar, curated [Scala Times](https://scalatimes.com), and spent years advocating for the language—fluctuating between deep admiration and mild frustration, as all Scala users do.
* [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) & [Nix](https://nixos.org) Foundations – Helping <b>two of my favorite</b> niche but mighty communities grow and thrive.
* [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), [SoftwareMill](https://softwaremill.com/open-source/), [VirtusLab](https://virtusity.com) – Worked across marketing, DevRel, and community engagement, making developer tools and FP languages more accessible.

### 👟 Side Quests
* Music Production – Because writing beats and writing Haskell both require creative problem-solving.
* My Garmin Fenix – We have a complicated relationship. It helps me track my runs, and I help it gather dust on my desk when I totally meant to go for a jog but got distracted by a new issue of [Haskell Weekly](https://haskellweekly.news).

### 🤝 Available for Business Cooperation
I’m open to freelance projects, consulting, and collaboration opportunities. Let’s talk!
